## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'openai'"
Run: `pip install openai gradio python-dotenv`

### "No API key provided"
Your API key should already be in the `.env` file. If not:
1. Open `.env` file
2. Make sure it has: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here`
3. Save and try again

### Can't hear audio
- Check your volume
- Make sure browser allows audio
- Try clicking the play button on the audio player
